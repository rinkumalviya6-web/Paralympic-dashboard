# Paralympic Games Medal Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze historical Paralympic Games medal data.
The dashboard highlights medal distribution trends across countries, years, sports, cities, and rankings,
helping users gain meaningful insights into performance patterns over time.

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- DAX
- Power Query
- Data Modeling
- Data Cleaning & Transformation

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains historical Paralympic Games data, including:
- Participating countries (NPCs) and rankings
- Gold, Silver, and Bronze medal counts
- Games year and host cities
- Sports categories
- Season, continent, and game type details
